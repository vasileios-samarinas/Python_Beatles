# Use the `beatles` list above to answer the following questions:

# 1. John Lennon also plays guitar. Access the `instrument` key in his dictionary and change its value:
beatles[0]['instrument']= "guitar"
print(beatles[0])
print(beatles[0:3])

# 2. Write a function which takes in the list of band members as a parameter,
#    and returns a list of all the Beatles' names:
# Expected result: ['John Lennon', 'Paul McCartney', 'George Harrison', 'Ringo Starr']
